# Things I use 
* Tmux (https://github.com/gpakosz/.tmux)
* Neovim with lazyvim(https://www.lazyvim.org)
* Wezterm/Alacritty
* Zsh with Ohmyzsh (https://ohmyz.sh/#install)
* Plasma Kde5

# Get started
 ```bash
  	sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rubiin/dotfiles/master/dot_bin/executable_install-all.sh)"
```


To backup plasma config, install kde5 plasma and then install latte sapcer and `konsave`(https://pypi.org/project/Konsave/) which is a python package and restore the tar file

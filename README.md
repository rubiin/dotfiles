# ~/dotfiles

What are dotfiles, you ask? They’re like the secret sauce that spices up your Unix-like environment, hiding in plain sight.These are the magical objects that make certain computers extremely use-able for me.
Use them wisely, or you may accidentally summon the wrath of the Terminal Gods! ⚡️

**Warning:** Installing these dotfiles may cause unexpected side effects, including but not limited to:

- **Spontaneous Joy**: You may find yourself smiling at your terminal like it just told you a really good joke.
- **Productivity Overload**: Be prepared to finish tasks so quickly that your coworkers will think you’ve discovered time travel.
- **Imposter Syndrome**: A sudden belief that you’re a coding guru, despite the fact that you still don’t know what `grep` does.
- **Keyboard Shortcut Obsession**: You might start using shortcuts for everything—expect your friends to look at you like you’re casting spells.
- **Existential Crises**: You’ll find yourself questioning your life choices as you realize you have more config files than actual files.
- **Terminal Tantrums**: Sudden outbursts of laughter or frustration when the terminal does something unexpected—don’t worry, it happens to the best of us.
- **Unsolicited Tech Support**: Friends and family may suddenly believe you’re a tech wizard and seek your help for their computer problems, whether you’re qualified or not.
- **Random Keyboard Dancing**: You might find yourself doing a little happy dance each time you nail a command on the first try.
- **Binge-Configuring**: Prepare for late nights filled with endless tweaking, as you discover new ways to make your terminal *even cooler*—it’s a slippery slope!
- **Philosophical Debates**: You may start questioning the meaning of life every time you encounter a bug—like, why does this `ls` command keep messing with me?

Use at your own risk, and remember: with great power comes great responsibility (and an abundance of memes). Enjoy the ride! 🚀

## FAQS
- Why do you use Arch?
* Because most software are readily available for arch through aur. There is 1 in a 10 chance that something you are not available on aur. Also Arch is minimal by default, allowing users to build their system from the ground up. You     install only what you need, leading to a more efficient setup. Arch teaches you how linux works like how neovim teaches you how an editor works.

- Why use tiling window manager?
* Tiling wm setup makes it easy to navigate with keyboard shortcuts, reducing reliance on the mouse. Tiling WMs are often minimal and customizable, helping users focus on their tasks. They’re also lightweight, suitable for older computers, and great for multitasking, allowing easy access to multiple applications at once. Overall, they offer a more efficient and organized computing experience.
